                        <h3>Our <span className="text-primary-custom">Vision</span></h3>
                        <p>We envision a world free from hunger, where communities are empowered to support one another. By leveraging technology, we create a seamless bridge between food surplus and food scarcity, ensuring that good food nourishes people, not landfills.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why We <span className="text-primary-custom">Started</span></h3>
                        <p>Meal Bridge was born from a simple yet powerful observation: the paradox of immense food waste coexisting with widespread hunger. We were driven to create a practical solutionâ€”a platform that makes it easy for individuals and businesses to donate surplus food and for charitable organizations to find it.</p>
